					Welcome to Starlight Studio, and thank
					you for getting to know who we are!
					My passion behind this project is to
					spark a joy for the magic of performing
					arts by creating memorable character
					experiences for children and families. I
					want this to be an outlet for
					imagination and opportunity for creative
					collaboration in the hudson valley
					community.

					Born and raised in Seattle, Washington,
					as a child I was fortunate to be
					surrounded by an abundance of performing
					arts experiences for children and young
					audiences. As a young adult, this
					allowed me opportunities for on-stage
					experience that set me on a path of
					passion for the performing arts.

					Moving to New Paltz, New York I fell in
					love with the community, and I have been
					serving the children and families of the
					hudson valley as a professional in early
					childhood education, in the classroom
					and now in leadership as a Program
					Director.

					My mission is to blend my love for

					enriching experiences for the children,
					families, and artists of the hudson
